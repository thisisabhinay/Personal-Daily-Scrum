# Personal Daily Scrum
**Web app to manage and keep track of daily personal scrum sessions.**

## What is the daily Scrum?
The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the *Development Team* to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint.

## Motivation
I personally found daily scrum exercise to boost my productivity at work. Hence, thought of applying it to personal life as well. And the result is this project - A single point to add and view all my daily scrum records.
